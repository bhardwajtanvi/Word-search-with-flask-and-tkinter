# Word-search-using python-with-flask-and-tkinter

TKapps is a basic word search tkinter desktop app .It has all files which were used during making of it. Its downloadable file to execute directly that application is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZUyu0xFdhx3r0V7oyCJdcm0cT41UCLua?usp=sharing
After downloading that exe ,install it and run tk1(file format of it would be application) and it will give you output.
This exe sharable application was made with NSIS : To download it the link of it is:https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download
And tutorial suggestion for NSIS from my end would be:https://youtu.be/WWkncTrjhUE
